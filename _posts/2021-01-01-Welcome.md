  Why hello there. My name is Anthony and today is the first day I've dedicated to learninig about how to actually USE GitHub. To be completely honest I probably visit this websit at least 2 or 3 times a day due to the fact I'm always tinkering with Linux which results in me having to come so i can find all the badass stuff that isnt on repos normally. That being said though I am in no way a master of Linux or programming for that matter. To be honest I really should have taken this step forward yearssss ago but alas I was more interested in partying back then. But I'm here now so thats all that matters and I can't wait to work with other people who love technology as much as I do.
